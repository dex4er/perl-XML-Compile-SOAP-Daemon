==== README to examples/namesservice/

This directory demonstrates the implementation of a SOAP server, mimicing
the behavior of an existing service.  The XML::Compile::SOAP distribution
demonstrates various ways to create clients for this same service.  Here,
we focus on the server implementation.

The original service published a nice WSDL file, and a separate schema,
which have been beautified a bit but nothing more.

 . namesservice.wsdl
   The WSDL file, describing the service.

 . namesservice.xsd
   The Schema file, describing the data types transmitted.

To run this example, first start the server
  ./server.pl -vvv

and then run the client
  ./client.pl

Please contribute.
