=== XML-Compile-SOAP-Daemon things to do
= last update: 2008-04-07, release 0.10

1. Test with SOAP1.2.
   waits for SOAP1.2 implementation in XML-Compile-SOAP

2. Test with WSDL1.2.
   waits for WSDL1.2 implementation in XML-Compile-SOAP

3. Demonstrate how to implement a proxy (simple).

4. Write automated regression tests.
   quite a lot of work, because it's a daemon.  For now, the example
   covers may corners of the implementation.

5. Reorganize the docs.
   currently, mostly in programming order...

6. Write section "Operation handlers" in lib/XML/Compile/SOAP/Daemon.pm
